-> Introduction

You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.


-> What is a Virtual Machine?

A virtual machine is a software capable of installing an Operating System within itself, making the OS think that it is hosted on a real computer. With virtual machines we can create virtual devices that will behave in the same way as physical devices, using their own CPU, memory, network interface and storage. This is possible because the virtual machine is hosted on a physical device, which is the one that provides the hardware resources to the VM. The software program that creates virtual machines is the hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for isolating the VM resources from the system hardware and making the necessary implementations so that the VM can use these resources.

-> What is LVM?

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is an abstraction layer between a storage device and a file system. We get many advantages from using LVM, but the main advantage is that we have much more flexibility when it comes to managing partitions.

-> What is AppArmor?

AppArmor provides Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security. In fact, AppAmor allows the system administrator to restrict the actions that processes can perform. For example, if an installed application can take photos by accessing the camera application, but the administrator denies this privilege, the application will not be able to access the camera application.

-> How to use SSH?

SSH or Secure Shell is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their servers over the Internet thanks to an authentication mechanism. Provides a mechanism to authenticate a user remotely, transfer data from the client to the host, and return a response to the request made by the client.
